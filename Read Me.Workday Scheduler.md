#WorkDay Scheduler
This challenge entailed creating day calendar with the timeslots on the left and save buttons the right.
Updated HTML elements and CSS selectors to reflect the challenge request of having present, past and future hours.
Additionally, used Jscript syntax to write code to show current day and navigate the work day calendar by entering notes in the time-block sections.
